Welcome to [Minima Reboot](https://github.com/aterenin/minima-reboot), a Bootstrap-based rewrite of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), the base Jekyll theme. Check out the responsive navigation menu and footer by changing your browser's width. This is a post in the `_posts` directory. You can view Minima Reboot's source on [GitHub](https://github.com/aterenin/minima-reboot). Minima Reboot inherits Jekyll's support for code highlighting, as shown below.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
